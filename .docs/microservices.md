# Microservices Architecture Principles
Core principles behind effective, scalable, performant, and maintainable microservice architectures, distilled.

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): 
Each microservice should do one thing and do it well, encapsulating a single business capability.
This limits blast radius and promotes independent development/deployment.

## Loose Coupling & High Cohesion:
**Loose Coupling:** Services should minimize dependencies on each other.
Communication should be via well-defined APIs (REST, gRPC, messaging) rather than shared databases or in-process calls.
**High Cohesion:** All components within a service should contribute to its single responsibility.

## Independent Deployability: 
Each service can be built, tested, and deployed independently of other services.
This requires automated pipelines and robust versioning strategies.

## Decentralized Data Management: 
Each service owns its data. 
Data consistency across services is achieved through eventual consistency patterns (e.g., sagas, event sourcing) rather than distributed transactions.
This avoids data contention and allows services to choose optimal data stores.

## Resilience & Fault Tolerance:
**Isolation:** Failures in one service should not cascade to others (e.g., bulkhead patterns, circuit breakers).
**Graceful Degradation:** Services should be designed to operate in a degraded mode when dependencies are unavailable.
**Retries & Timeouts:** Implement intelligent retry mechanisms with backoff and clear timeouts for inter-service communication.
**Observability:** Comprehensive logging, metrics, and distributed tracing are critical for understanding service behavior, diagnosing issues, and monitoring performance in a distributed system.

## Automation:
Automate everything: provisioning, deployment, scaling, testing, and monitoring.
This is essential for managing the complexity of many independent services.

## Consumer-Driven Contracts (CDCs):
Define and enforce agreements between service consumers and providers.
This ensures API compatibility and prevents breaking changes during independent deployments.

## Evolutionary Design:
Microservice architectures are inherently iterative.
Design for change and anticipate that service boundaries will evolve over time. 
Avoid big-front design.

## Stateless Services (where possible): 
Favor stateless services to simplify scaling and improve resilience.
Externalize session state to dedicated data stores.

## API Gateway:
A single entry point for clients, handling concerns like routing, authentication, rate limiting, and potentially request aggregation, shielding clients from the underlying service topology.
